# Foundry 101 Smart Contract Implementations

Welcome to my repository for the Foundry 101 course by Cyfrin Updraft. This project encompasses my implementations of smart contracts and the corresponding tools and practices covered in the course.

## Overview

The Foundry 101 course is a comprehensive introduction to developing and testing smart contracts using Foundry. The course covers various fundamental and advanced topics, including:

- **Basics of Deploying Smart Contracts**: Understanding how to deploy smart contracts to the blockchain.
- **Unit Testing**: Writing and executing unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual components.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between different components to validate the system as a whole.
- **Fuzzing**: Implementing fuzz testing to detect vulnerabilities and edge cases.
- **Scripting**: Writing scripts to automate tasks and interact with smart contracts.
- **Makefiles**: Utilizing Makefiles to streamline build and deployment processes.
- **Modularity**: Structuring smart contracts and code for reusability and maintainability.
